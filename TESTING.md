## Validator Testing 

### W3C Validator

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all three pages of the website. No errors or warnings were found on html pages.

The [Jigsaw W3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS code. All the  errors on CSS validation were related to [Font awesome]( https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css).

## Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
