## Validator Testing 

### W3C Validator

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all three pages of the website. No errors or warnings were found on html pages.

The [Jigsaw W3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS code. All the  errors on CSS validation were related to [Font awesome](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css).

- [Home Page HTML](documentation/testing/home-page-validation.png)
- [Gallery Page HTML](documentation/testing/gallery-page-validation.png)
- [Contact Page HTML](documentation/testing/form-page-validation.png)
- [CSS](documentation/testing/css-validation-home.png)

During the first validation through [Freeformater](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html) semantc errors (no h2 within sections) were highlighted. They have since been rectified.

## Unfixed Bugs

- The Lighthouse results are not consistent. |When the results are low the problem is the size of the images which were already compressed several timeas. 

- The only problem with browser compatability is the Contact page on Yandex: the fieldset was too wide.
